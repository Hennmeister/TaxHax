## Inspiration

If you make more than $11,000 a year, you must file your taxes. Even if you donâ€™t, you can still do your taxes because it's a great practice! Your information will already be on file and it will be easier to do your taxes the next time around. But, who enjoys taxes? Unknown to most, students can gain many benefits by filing their taxes. TaxHax offers a fun and interactive solution to the problem that is the mundane process of filing taxes.

## What it does

TaxHax is an educational quiz all about taxes and specifically targeted to students. With direct questions and links to further resources, people of all experience levels can find the information specifically relevant to them about filing taxes in Canada.

## How we built it

We built TaxHax using the React framework.

## Challenges we ran into

Presenting information in a digestible manner was difficult. A lot of information about taxes was available to us, however, pinpointing the most important facts students should be aware of was a lengthy process. Figuring out what would make learning about taxes more fun was also a challenge. We decided to proceed with a quiz. Who doesn't love quizzes?

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of experimenting with React and learning how to use it. We're also proud of how well we collaborated on the project.

## What we learned

We learned about web development and the React framework. We also learned about the benefits of filing taxes in all Canadian provinces.

## What's next for TaxHax

In the future, we would like to make TaxHax a more comprehensive resource. We would love to help educate the rest of the Canadian population about taxes in a more exciting way. We would also like to improve our UX/UI.
